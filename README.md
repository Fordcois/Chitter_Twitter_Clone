# About the Chitter Project

## Project Overview

Chitter is a small web application that draws inspiration from Twitter. This project aims to create a Twitter-like experience, allowing users to register accounts, share their thoughts in the form of "Cheeps," and explore content shared by others. Chitter is built using a stack of modern web development technologies, including Python, Flask, CSS, and PostgreSQL.

## Key Features

### User Registration and log-ins

Chitter offers a user-friendly registration process, enabling users to create accounts - An account is required to post cheeps.

### Cheep Sharing (CRUD)

Similar to Twitter, Chitter provides a complete Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) system for Cheeps. Users can create new Cheeps, view their own Cheeps, and delete Cheeps if they wish to remove them.

### Explore Cheeps

- **Browse All Cheeps:** Chitter users can explore all the Cheeps shared on the platform, offering access to a wide variety of content.

- **Browse by User:** Users can view Cheeps posted by specific users, making it easy to stay updated with the activities of others.

- **Browse by Hashtag:** Chitter allows users to discover Cheeps related to specific topics by searching for and clicking on relevant hashtags.

### Interactive User Interface

Chitter's user interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing an enjoyable and engaging user experience.

## Planned Features

In the pursuit of enhancing Chitter, we have exciting features on the horizon, including:

- **Ability to Follow/Be Followed by Users:** Planning to introduce a user following system, allowing users to connect with others they find interesting.

- **'Like' Cheeps:** We're working on adding the ability to 'like' Cheeps. Express your appreciation for a Cheep by giving it a 'like' and let others know your thoughts.

- **Email Notifications When Tagged:** Developing a feature to send email notifications when you are tagged in a Cheep, so you never miss a mention.

- **Clickable Hashtags:** Make hashtags in Cheeps clickable links to their relevant search pages, making it easy to explore content related to specific topics.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Chitter is powered by Python, with Flask serving as the lightweight web framework.
